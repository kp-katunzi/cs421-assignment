Troubleshooting Tips and Problem	Solution
->Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use	MySQL is already running on port 3306. Stop it: sudo systemctl stop mysql
->denied: requested access to the resource is denied	You forgot to docker login before pushing images.
->Flask server accessible on localhost but not public IP	Make sure Flask binds to 0.0.0.0 and EC2 Security Group allows port 8000 or 5000.
Docker Compose not recognized	Install Docker Compose: sudo apt install docker-compose
