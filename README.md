Docker Deployment
Building Docker Images
Inside your project directory (hamisi-api/):

bash
Copy
Edit
# Build the Docker images using Docker Compose
sudo docker-compose build
This will create:

hamisi-api_api:latest — Your Flask API container.

mysql:8.0 — The MySQL database container.

Running the Containers
bash
Copy
Edit
# Run containers in the background
sudo docker-compose up -d
You can view running containers with:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
Viewing Container Logs
bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs <container_name>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs hamisi-api_api_1
Docker Registry Upload

docker tag hamisi-api_api hamisishehe05/hamisi-api:latest
2. Login to Docker Hub
bash
Copy
Edit
docker login
Enter your Docker Hub username and password.

3. Push the Image
bash
Copy

Troubleshooting Tips and Problem	Solution
->Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use	MySQL is already running on port 3306. Stop it: sudo systemctl stop mysql
->denied: requested access to the resource is denied	You forgot to docker login before pushing images.
->Flask server accessible on localhost but not public IP	Make sure Flask binds to 0.0.0.0 and EC2 Security Group allows port 8000 or 5000.
Docker Compose not recognized	Install Docker Compose: sudo apt install docker-compose
